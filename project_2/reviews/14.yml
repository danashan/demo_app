good_apps:
  - name: Sketch Book Pro 
    url: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sketchbook-pro-for-ipad/id364253478?mt=8
    note: I like it because of the integrated gestures, simple menus, and powerful functions.
  - name: Uzu
    url: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/uzu/id376551723?mt=8
    note: This app is amazing I've spent hours on it and it does absolutely nothing constructive. 
  - name: Flipboard
    url: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flipboard/id358801284?mt=8
    note: Keeps the flow of information coming. Easy to use, caches enough of the story so you don't have to wait for a load to get the first paragraph. Integrated gestures.
  - name: GoodReader
    url: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/goodreader-for-ipad/id363448914?mt=8
    note: One of the more complicated programs in terms of controls and function. Despite an overwhelming number of buttons (especially in early versions) the app is very production and integrates well with other services.
  - name: VNC Viewer
    url: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vnc-viewer/id352019548?mt=8
    note: Makes use of a popular and useful protocol and has a simple interface.
bad_apps:
  - name: Data Analysis
    url: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dataanalysis/id375603883?mt=8
    note: Could not figure out how to use it in five minutes. Im sure it does something but it lost my interest.
  - name: HeadSpace
    url: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/headspace/id300244538?mt=8
    note: Bad implementation of graphically showing hierarchical information, good idea, but not at all practical.
  - name: Hand X-Ray Scanner
    url: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hand-x-ray-scanner/id365953945?mt=8
    note: I dislike the fact that there is no function of than entertaining the extremely gullible.  
  - name: Facebook
    url: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/facebook/id284882215?mt=8
    note: Clunky, user items such as pictures not organized well, certain information completely inaccessible.
  - name: Draw
    url: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/draw-for-ipad/id363207607?mt=8
    note: Out of the space available to write on, the app cuts your screen to about 70% of its potential. As you draw a lined, it is stored I'm memory in a way that the app slows substantially that longer the line.
