good_apps:
  - name: Dungeon Raid
    url: http://appshopper.com/games/dungeon-raid
    note: Amazing game. Very simple interface by hours of entertainment.
  - name: Angry Birds
    url: http://appshopper.com/games/angry-birds
    note: The pinnacle of mobile development games.
  - name: Fruit Ninja
    url: http://appshopper.com/games/fruit-ninja
    note: Another great game. Very popular for a reason. Very addicting.
  - name: Camera+
    url: http://appshopper.com/photography/camera...the-ultimate-photo-app
    note: A huge overhaul for the camera on IOS. I own it and it is very fun.
  - name: Words With Friends
    url: http://appshopper.com/games/words-with-friends
    note: Basically scrabble but networked. A great example of a networking app.
bad_apps:
  - name: Photo55
    url: http://appshopper.com/photography/photo55
    note: Recreates functionality available in apps such as Camera+ but at the same price lacking all other features. Pointless app.
  - name: Alarm Clock Rio
    url: http://appshopper.com/utilities/alarm-clock-rio
    note: Pointless app, only has functionality that is already included in IOS and it costs money.
  - name: Reckless Driver
    url: http://appshopper.com/games/reckless-getaway
    note: You may notice a theme here but this app costs $3 and has very similar gameplay and adds very little compared to similar games. Did well at first and then fell like a stone.
  - name: Password Safe - iPassSafe
    url: http://appshopper.com/productivity/ipasssafe
    note: There are better, cheaper, apps out there. No real appeal.
  - name: Marvel Comics
    url: http://appshopper.com/books/marvel-comics
    note: I may just not understand the point of this app but I would think that making a proprietary app to read a comic would by overshadowed by any form of reader client for the IOS.
